Assignment 1: This is a basic c# store program that uses inheritance and
	an abstract base class to create multiple subclasses that store data
	on different items.

Required Files: the original Assignment_1.cs files included with this 
	zip file

Run the Program: Open it in a c# compatible IDE and run. The program will 
	display multiple prompts to the user, so follow them

Assumptions: The user can read and work a computer. Also the user is a bit 
	malicious and tries to break the program.

Challenges: Getting access to item data like their names and types.

Design Decisions: I decided to outfit my program so that the user can't 
	easily break the program. Moved all classes after the main method 
	to make it easier to look at.

Bugs: If you enter the maximum data a primitive variable can hold there might be a
	problem

Conclusion: Overall the project was a nice introduction to c#. My program 
	accomplishes everything that is required of it and then some. Given
	that I assumed the user may try to break the program I implemented
	counters to keep it going.

If I had More Time: I would make my program more robust when it comes to
	error.
